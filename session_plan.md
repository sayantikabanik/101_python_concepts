# Python Stock Price Analysis Dashboard - 1-Hour Learning Session

This session is designed to teach participants how to build a Python-based stock price analysis dashboard using Kaggle datasets, Pixi for environment management, and Bokeh for interactive visualizations.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
1. Set up a Python development environment using Pixi and understand its benefits.
2. Fetch and process stock market data from Kaggle using Python scripts.
3. Create interactive visualizations for stock price analysis using Bokeh.
4. Integrate data and visualizations into a dynamic dashboard.

## Session Outline (60 Minutes)

### 1. **Introduction and Setup (10 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Familiarize participants with the project structure and tools.
   - **Topics Covered**:
     - Overview of the project and its goals.
     - Introduction to Pixi for dependency and environment management.
   - **Activities**:
     - Walkthrough of the project structure.
     - Hands-on: Install dependencies and activate the environment.
     ```sh
     pixi install
     pixi shell
     ```

### 2. **Data Acquisition and Processing (15 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Teach participants how to fetch and process stock market data.
   - **Topics Covered**:
     - Setting up Kaggle API credentials.
     - Writing a Python script to fetch data from Kaggle.
     - Processing the downloaded data for visualization.
   - **Activities**:
     - Live coding: Implementing the `fetch_online.py` script.
     ```python
     # filepath: /101_python_concepts/dataset/fetch_online.py
     import kaggle
     import pandas as pd

     def fetch_stock_data():
         kaggle.api.dataset_download_files(
             'twlo-stock-data',
             path='./dataset',
             unzip=True
         )
         print("Data downloaded successfully!")
     ```
     - Hands-on: Run the Pixi task to download the dataset.
     ```sh
     pixi run 101_kaggle_data
     ```

### 3. **Interactive Visualization with Bokeh (20 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Enable participants to create interactive visualizations for stock price analysis.
   - **Topics Covered**:
     - Introduction to Bokeh and its key features.
     - Creating a line chart for stock prices.
     - Adding interactivity (zoom, pan, hover tools).
   - **Activities**:
     - Live coding: Build a basic Bokeh visualization.
     ```python
     # filepath: /101_python_concepts/dashboard/simple_stock_analysis_dashboard.ipynb
     from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
     from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource

     # Sample data
     data = {'date': ['2025-01-01', '2025-01-02'], 'close': [150, 155]}
     source = ColumnDataSource(data)

     # Create figure
     p = figure(title="TWLO Stock Prices", x_axis_label='Date', y_axis_label='Price', x_axis_type='datetime')
     p.line(x='date', y='close', source=source, line_width=2)

     show(p)
     ```
     - Hands-on: Customize the chart with additional features (e.g., tooltips, legends).

### 4. **Dashboard Integration (15 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Combine data and visualizations into a cohesive dashboard.
   - **Topics Covered**:
     - Structuring a dashboard layout.
     - Adding multiple visualizations and interactivity.
   - **Activities**:
     - Live coding: Integrate visualizations into a dashboard.
     ```python
     from bokeh.layouts import column
     from bokeh.io import curdoc

     # Combine visualizations
     layout = column(p)
     curdoc().add_root(layout)
     ```
     - Hands-on: Add additional charts or widgets (e.g., dropdowns, sliders).
